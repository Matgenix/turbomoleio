<span id="developer-testing"></span><h1>Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#testing" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Tests are an essential part of the development process. Their aim is to check that the
different portions of the code meet their design and behave as intended. Providing an exhaustive
guide about how to write tests in python is beyond the scope of this document, so in this section we
will instead explain the details of the tests in turbomoleio: how they are organized,
what are the tools available and how you should proceed to introduce tests for your new developments.</p>
<p>In turbomoleio we divide the tests in two groups. The definition could be considered somewhat
arbitrary with respect to the standard ones, but in the following we use the following naming convention:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>unit tests</strong>: aiming at testing each single component on its own (no TURBOMOLE executable
runs inside these tests).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>integration tests</strong>: testing the integration among different components and in particular
with the TURBOMOLE executables.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When implementing a new feature you should always implement a series of tests before
adding it to turbomoleio. It is also important to consider adding new tests when a bug is identified
and fixed. This will prevent that such a bug will be reintroduced in later developments.</p>
<section id="the-test-suite">
<span id="developer-test-suite"></span><h2>The test suite<a class="headerlink" href="#the-test-suite" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The testing suite is based on <strong>pytest</strong> and makes wide use of its functionalities, like for example
fixtures, marking and custom command line arguments. The pytest package should thus be installed
and the tests should be executed using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pytest</span></code> command. For a reference on all its features you
can refer to the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.pytest.org">pytest documentation</a>. To get the coverage of the
tests you also need to install the <strong>pytest-cov</strong> package.</p>
<p>Summing up, aside from the standard dependencies in turbomoleio, the easiest way to prepare your environment
to run the tests is to run</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>pytest<span class="w"> </span>pytest-cov<span class="w"> </span>mongomock
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To run the integration tests of course a standard installation of Turbomole should be available, so
that the tests can call the different executables.</p>
<p>Once this is done you can run each test separately going to the different folders and executing
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pytest</span></code> command or use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">runtest.sh</span></code> script present in the root folder of the project.
Running <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">runtest.sh</span> <span class="pre">-u</span></code> will run all the unit tests, while <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">runtest.sh</span> <span class="pre">-i</span></code> will run all
the integration tests. In both cases it will produce a detailed report of the level of coverage.
If you wish, you can then run</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>coverage<span class="w"> </span>html<span class="w"> </span>-d<span class="w"> </span>coverage_html
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>to generate an html version of the coverage report. The configurations for the coverage are given
in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.coveragerc_unit</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.coveragerc_integration</span></code> files, present in the root folder of
the project.</p>
</section>
<section id="unit-tests">
<h2>Unit tests<a class="headerlink" href="#unit-tests" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>As mentioned above, we call unit tests those that test each single component on its own.
Each module folder in turbomoleio contains a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tests</span></code> subfolder where the unit tests for
all the components in that module are implemented.
All the functions, objects and their methods have some unit test that will verify that
it behaves as expected. This is done, for example, by checking:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the returned values of functions and methods,</p></li>
<li><p>the attributes set in objects,</p></li>
<li><p>the side effects of a function (e.g. creation or modification of files),</p></li>
<li><p>that the expected exceptions are raised under specific conditions,</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These tests will be limited to a specific component and thus may require to
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html">mock</a> functions or objects to determine
a specific outcome of the test (see <a class="reference external" href="https://realpython.com/python-mock-library/">this guide</a>
for some examples). Mocks are also required for
all the calls towards external applications and in particular to the TURBOMOLE executables.
Since in the turbomoleio code the calls to TURBOMOLE executables is done for the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DefineRunner</span></code>
class, specific mocks will be done for its testing.</p>
<p>For all the cases where inputs and outputs should be read or modified a set of prepared files are
used. These files, mainly Turbomole inputs and outputs, are stored in the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">turbomoleio/testfiles</span></code> folder.
Using these test files and with the additional help of the mocking it is possible to direct and
verify in detail what happens inside the component under test. For this reason the unit tests can achieve
a very high coverage rate, of the code, where by coverage we intend the fraction of the lines of
code that are executed by at least one test. As of version 1.0.0 the global coverage of the unit
tests alone is 99% and developers should aim at keeping this value as high as possible.</p>
<p>The unit-testing for the output files is performed for multiple versions of Turbomole. The reference
files for these tests are stored in the <cite>turbomoleio/testfiles/outputs</cite> folder for each Turbomole version,
e.g. <cite>turbomoleio/testfiles/outputs/TM_v7.3.1</cite>. Additionnally, a <cite>turbomoleio/testfiles/outputs/generation</cite>
folder contains the necessary information to generate new output files for a new Turbomole version using
a specific development script (see <a class="reference internal" href="#developer-utest-output"><span class="std std-ref">Unit-tests for output parsing</span></a>).</p>
</section>
<section id="integration-tests">
<h2>Integration tests<a class="headerlink" href="#integration-tests" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Integration tests aim to verify the integration between the different components and
in particular with the Turbomole executables. For this reason they are all collected in the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">turbomoleio/integrations_tests</span></code> folder and, to allow to execute them separately, they
are all <em>marked</em> by setting the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">integration</span></code> pytest mark for each module:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">pytestmark</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">pytest</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">mark</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">integration</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Since, aside from in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DefineRunner</span></code>, in the turbomole source code there are no explicit
calls to TURBOMOLE executable, the integration tests will also check if the I/O features implemented
keep working in the same way when the files are directly used or produced by TURBOMOLE.
To be more explicit one can check if a file that has been produced or modified with
turbomoleio keeps being read correctly in TURBOMOLE and if an output file produced
by an execution of TURBOMOLE is still parsed correctly. For some functionalities anyway
there is not really a meaning in performing an integration test. In these cases the
portion of the code can be excluded from the coverage analysis.</p>
<p>The integration tests are all performed using the <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">turbomoleio.testfiles.utils.run_itest()</span></code>
helper function. This first runs <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">define</span></code> using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DefineRunner</span></code> based on the parameters given
in input, the produced control file is compared with a reference stored previously. If successful
the required turbomole executables are run and the outputs are extracted using the objects
implemented here. The numerical values of these outputs are checked with a respect to
references stored in JSON files. Note that the comparison is performed using the
<code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">turbomoleio.testfiles.utils.assert_almost_equal()</span></code>. For this comparison some values
are outright excluded from the check. In some cases a comparison will be obviously meaningless
(e.g. the date of execution, the elapsed time), while in some other cases the values,
while physically and chemically equivalent, may be reported in slightly different ways in
the TURBOMOLE output and it would be extremely impractical to make a meaningful
comparison for them (e.g. the  order of the acoustic modes from aoforce
can vary on different machines, even for the same version of TURBOMOLE. While checking the
list of eigenvalues is trivial, verifying that the two lists of eigenvectors, represented
in different order, are indeed equivalent up to a numerical tolerance would be cumbersome).</p>
<p>This procedure is repeated for different kinds of inputs and for the different
TURBOMOLE executables currently supported by the turbomoleio objects.</p>
<p>Aside from preventing the introduction of errors when modifying existing parts of the code,
integration tests can thus be used to verify that the implemented I/O functionalities
will keep working for <strong>new versions of TURBOMOLE</strong>. It is inevitable that when moving
from one TURBOMOLE version to another at least some of the integration tests will fail. This
might be for some changes in the inputs, in the underlying implementations or even for some
options being removed or renamed altogether. Another possibility is that the output given
in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">stdout</span></code> has changed its format and that the parser now fails to correctly
extract the results of the calculation. turbomoleio has been initially developed to
target TURBOMOLE version 7.3 and the tests are designed for that specific version only.
As new versions of TURBOMOLE are released the tests can be updated to match the new input and outputs
definitions, but care should be taken by checking exactly which part of the test is leading
to a failure.</p>
<p>In light of all this, two custom options have been added to pytest in turbomoleio. The first is a way
to tune the value of the tolerance when comparing numerical values. This can be changed by
running the tests with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--itest-tol</span></code>. For example running</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pytest<span class="w"> </span>--itest-tol<span class="o">=</span><span class="m">0</span>.01
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>performs a much looser comparison (note that this is an absolute tolearance).
The second option is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--generate-itest-ref</span></code>. When running
the tests with this option, instead of using the reference files to check the
correctness of the outputs produced by the tests, the outputs will instead be used to generate
a new version of the JSON reference files and overwrite the previous ones.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--generate-itest-ref</span></code> should be used with extreme care. The original files
provided with turbomoleio have been tested across different machines
to verify that the tests pass on different environments. This option should
be used only if the output objects parser are changed or if the reference version of TURBOMOLE
is updated. In any case it would be wise not to run the whole set of tests with this option,
but instead target only the specific test for which the reference file should be updated.
For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pytest<span class="w"> </span>--generate-itest-ref<span class="w"> </span>test_dscf.py<span class="w"> </span>-k<span class="w"> </span>test_run_dscf_hf
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Writing integration tests that trigger all the possible cases in the code is basically impossible.
Some errors and checks in the source code are only triggered in presence of exceptional errors
(e.g. wrongly formatted output files) and this cannot be easily reproduced systematically.
In addition, while there is no strict limit for the execution time of a single test, these should be
short enough to be executed in a reasonable amount of time with small computational resources.
Lastly for some functions and objects there is little gain in testing their behavior in direct connection
with an actual TURBOMOLE calculation. For all these reasons the aim for the coverage of the integration
tests is lower compared to the unit tests. As of version 1.0.0 the integration tests alone cover 89% of
the turbomoleio source code.</p>
</section>
<section id="writing-new-tests">
<h2>Writing new tests<a class="headerlink" href="#writing-new-tests" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>New contributions to turbomoleio should always come with their set of unit and, if suitable, integration tests.
The tests that you add should be organized in the same way as the other tests already available,
as described in the previous sections.</p>
<p>The test functions and files should be named starting with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">test_</span></code> to be correctly discovered by
pytest (this can be customized, but sticking to the standard is the easiest option). If you have some
experience with the standard python testing utils, notice that in turbomoleio you should <em>not</em>
subclass <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">unittest.TestCase</span></code>, since this is incompatible with some of the functionalities in
pytest. All the options provided by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TestCase</span></code> can be easily replaced by pytest options and
fixtures.</p>
<p>As for the other developments, you can use the tests already present as a reference for implementing
your own. Several resources are available online discussing the testing best practices and the
pytest documentation is a good starting point as well. Here we will limit to the description of
the options and utils specific to turbomoleio.</p>
<p>Helper functions and utilities specific for testing can be found in the <code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">turbomoleio.testfiles.utils</span></code>
module. In particular this contains a context manager that is used in most of the tests present
in the test suite: <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">turbomoleio.testfiles.utils.temp_dir()</span></code>.
Whenever you write a test that needs to access files from or write files to the file system this should be done
in a temporary directory specific for the test, otherwise the files will be written all over the project
folders. This context manager can be easily used to create the temporary directory, optionally change directory
to that one, and changing back to the initial directory when leaving the context manager, optionally
deleting the temporary directory..</p>
<p>This function can be used in connection with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">delete_tmp_dir</span></code> fixture, that should be passed
to its <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">delete</span></code> argument. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">delete_tmp_dir</span></code>, a boolean value <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">True</span></code> by default, can be switched
to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">False</span></code> calling pytest with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--keep-tmpdir</span></code> option. When this happens the path to the
temporary folder will be printed (with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print</span></code> function) by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">temp_dir</span></code>. This means that you will
have this in the output for the failing tests and this will give you the way to inspect the files that were
used and produced by the test and better understand why a test has failed.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">delete_tmp_dir</span></code>, as well as the other general fixtures, is implemented in the pytest standard <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">conftest.py</span></code>
file in the root folder of the project, with the others being mainly options to ease the access to the
test files. These files are stored in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">turbomoleio/testfiles</span></code> folder. You can add there the files that
might be needed for your unit and integration tests. Modifying existing files is possible, even though discouraged.
If it cannot be avoided (e.g. for the update to a new TURBOMOLE version) you should at least
check that all the tests relying on the files that you plan to modify will keep working as expected.</p>
<section id="tests-for-output-parsing">
<h3>Tests for output parsing<a class="headerlink" href="#tests-for-output-parsing" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>In order to create a new unit test for output parsing, you should:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Create a test directory in the <cite>~turbomoleio/testfiles/outputs/generation</cite> directory.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The test directory should be in the executable directory (i.e. the directory with the same name as the
Turbomole executable being tested). The executable directory should be created if it is not yet there. The
name of the test directory itself should be descriptive of the test. For example,
if you create a test for an ridft output, using benzene and a specific exchange correlation functional,
you could create a directory <cite>~turbomoleio/testfiles/outputs/generation/ridft/benzene_myxc</cite>. This
test-specific generation folder is referenced hereafter as the TESTGEN folder. The executable under testing
is referenced hereafter as TESTEXEC and the name of the test is referenced hereafter as TESTNAME.
An excerpt of the directory tree structure of the entire generation folder is shown hereafter:</p>

<li><p>Place the coord file of the molecule/system in the TESTGEN folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a test.yaml file in the TESTGEN folder.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This test.yaml file should contain the relevant information to automatically generate the control file
and run the Turbomole executable or possibly a series of Turbomole executables (in case the tested
executable cannot be run without a prior calculation). Look at other test.yaml files to see how this file
is structured.</p>
<ol class="arabic" start="5">
<li><p>Generate the reference files using the <cite>generate_output_files.py</cite> development script:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>python generate_output_files.py –test TESTEXEC TESTNAME –generate_control</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>6. Add the test in the <cite>tests_config.yaml</cite> current Turbomole version directory of
<cite>~turbomoleio/testfiles/outputs/TM_vX.Y.Z</cite>. For example, if this new test is added in turbomoleio 1.5,

version 7.7 (and thus turbomoleio 1.5.x), change your Turbomole distribution to version 7.7
and apply the following list of actions.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><dl>
<dt>Integration tests</dt><dd><p>1.1 Run <cite>pytest -m “integration”</cite></p>
<p>1.2 If there are errors (very likely) in 1.1, run <cite>pytest -m “integration” –dryrun-itest</cite>
to generate a json file containing the differences between the two versions (both at the level
of the control file and at the level of the generated output files). Very often, the main differences
are due to different values or options generated by <cite>define</cite> for the control file. You can
also run the new version of Turbomole with the old control file using <cite>pytest -m “integration”
–dryrun-itest –dryrun-use-reference-control</cite>. Check carefully whether these differences are
critical. Take appropriate measures if the differences are critical.</p>
<p>1.3 If no critical differences are found, generate the new reference control and output files
using <cite>pytest -m “integration” –generate-itest-ref</cite>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl>
<dt>Output parsing</dt><dd><p>2.1 Go in ~turbomoleio/dev_scripts and run <cite>python generate_output_files.py –dryrun</cite>.
A <cite>parsing_update_differences.json</cite> file is created in the new test version directory with the list of
differences for each output parsing test with respect to the previous Turbomole version. By default,
the old control file is used for this dry run.</p>
<p>2.2 Inspect the differences found in 2.1. If the differences are reasonable, generate the new
reference files for the new Turbomole version by running <cite>python generate_output_files.py
–generate_control</cite>. By default, the directory for the new Turbomole version is “TM_vX.Y.Z”.</p>
<p>2.3 Update the list of supported Turbomole versions for the output parsing in
~turbomoleio/testfiles/utils.py by appending “TM_vX.Y.Z” to the list.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
<p>3. Change the minor version of turbomoleio for the new Turbomole version as described
in <a class="reference internal" href="versioning.html#developer-versioning"><span class="std std-ref">Versioning</span></a>.</p>

<h4>Integration tests<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>For the integration tests, the check and generation is performed using the pytest
infrastructure. The integration tests are run using:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>pytest -m “integration”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This will run the integration tests with the version of Turbomole found in the system.
Most likely, a series of errors will occur. A “dryrun” execution of the integration
tests can then be performed to analyze the differences with respect to the previous
Turbomole version using:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>pytest -m “integration” –dryrun-itest</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In that case, a json file containing the differences with respect to the previous
Turbomole version will be generated. This json file (by default “dryrun_itest.json”)
contains the differences found in the control file as well as in the output files
for each integration test. You can change the path and name of this json file with the
<cite>–dryrun-fpath</cite> option of pytest.</p>
<p>Most of the time, the main difference arises from different default values generated
by define in the control file. It can be useful to compare the newest Turbomole version
with the older one using the previous reference control file using:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>pytest -m “integration” –dryrun-itest –dryrun-use-reference-control</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>If the differences found using this setup are small, one should in principle safely
assume that transition can be performed. The reference files for the integration tests
are then regenerated using:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>pytest -m “integration” –generate-itest-ref</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Note that this will override all the previous reference files and should be performed
with care (first checking the differences as described above) !</p>

<span id="developer-utest-output"></span><h4>Unit-tests for output parsing<a class="headerlink" href="#unit-tests-for-output-parsing" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>In order to keep backward compatibility of the parsing of the outputs of previous
Turbomole versions, output files and reference serialized objects for the new Turbomole
version have to be checked and generated. Note that the old output files and
reference serialized file objects are kept and still tested. A development script has
been implemented to facilitate the generation of the new output files and reference
serialized file objects. This script is located in:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>~turbomoleio/dev_scripts/generate_output_files.py</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Run the script using “–help” to get a list of the options available for this script.</p>
<p>It is important to know that the script can be run either in dry mode or in generation mode. In
dry mode, a <cite>parsing_update_differences.json</cite> file is generated with all the differences found in the tests
between the current Turbomole version and the control and output files of the previous Turbomole
version.</p>
