===========
turbomoleio
===========

turbomoleio is a python library containing a set of tools for the generation of inputs and parsing of
outputs for `TURBOMOLE <http://www.turbomole.com/>`_, based on the open-source `pymatgen <http://pymatgen.org/>`_
library. turbomoleio is compatible with python version 3.6 and higher and is designed to be interfaced with
TURBOMOLE version 7.3. Even though it is likely that most functionalities can be used with
subsequent versions, full compatibility is not guaranteed.

The main features of turbomoleio include:

* generation of the input files with the execution of ``define`` based on a set of parameters
* an interface for several of the files generated by TURBOMOLE, like for example the ``control`` and
  ``energy`` files.
* the ``MoleculeSystem``, an object that can be used for reading and generating ``coord`` files,
  based on the pymatgen ``Molecule`` object.
* a ``Parser`` for the extraction of the most relevant data from the text output of the most common
  TURBOMOLE calculations.

Note that most of the objects have been designed to be ``MSONable`` (from the `monty <http://guide.materialsvirtuallab.org/monty/>`_
package). This provides a way to naturally store input and output objects in JSON format and MongoDB databases,
enabling their use in connection with the `FireWorks <https://materialsproject.github.io/fireworks/>`_ workflow
manager. More details about all the objects available and how to use them can be found in the following user guide.
